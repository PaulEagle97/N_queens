"""
This script contains several algorithm implementations for solving the N-Queens puzzle.
The puzzle is defined as follows: there is a chess board of size <n>. It is necessary to place
<n> number of queens on it, so that none of the queens attacks any other queen.
The user is given a choice of <n>.

There can be only one queen per row/column/diagonal.
The placement of queens on the board can be represented by a sequence (c0, c1, c2, c3, ... c(n-1)), 
where each element represents a column of the board and its value is the number of a row. Thus, it 
gives us complete coordinates for each queen.
